# mavlink-drone-api
This is a python API for drones using mavlink as a communication protocol. It can be used to build ground control stations for UAVs using pixhawk/pixhawk2 flight controllers with the PX4 stack. The API is specifically built for quadrotors, but can be modified to support any type of drone with ease.
